# Enable Vulkan Renderer on Samsung S23 Using Shizuku and Termux

A step-by-step guide to enabling the Vulkan graphics API on your Samsung Galaxy S23 device **directly on-device**-no computer required. This method uses [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) and [Termux](https://termux.com/) to grant privileged access for system property changes. Enabling Vulkan graphics API potentially improves performance, reduces heat, and extends battery life according to reports from Reddit users.

## Overview

**Vulkan** is a modern, low-overhead graphics API that offers improved performance and efficiency over older APIs like OpenGL. This guide shows you how to enable Vulkan on your S23 device without needing a computer, using only Termux and Shizuku.

---

## Requirements

- Samsung Galaxy S23 
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) (from Google Play, F-Droid, or GitHub)
- [Termux](https://termux.com/) (from F-Droid or GitHub; **avoid Play Store version**)
- Wi-Fi connection

---

## Tool Setup (This is initial setup; you just need to do it one time ; It is not that hard )

1. **Install Shizuku**
   - Download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku).
2. **Install Termux**
   - Use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).
   - **Avoid the Play Store version** (it’s experimental and may not work properly).
3. **Start the Shizuku service**
   - Open the Shizuku app and follow the instructions to start the service (usually via wireless debugging).
4. **Enable Shizuku for terminal apps**
   - In Shizuku, tap **"Use Shizuku in terminal apps"**.
5. **Export Shizuku files**
   - Tap **"Export files"** in Shizuku, choose the **Download** folder, create a folder named `shizuku`, select it, and confirm with **"Use this folder"**.
6. **Set up Termux storage**
   - Open Termux and run:
     ```
     termux-setup-storage
     ```
7. **Move and configure Shizuku files in Termux**
   - Run the following commands in Termux:
     ```
     mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
     mv ~/storage/downloads/shizuku/* ~/.local/bin/
     sed -i 's/PKG/com.termux/g' ~/.local/bin/rish
     chmod 777 ~/.local/bin/rish
     echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
     . .bashrc
     ```
   - This sets up the `rish` command for privileged operations in Termux.
   - Type `rish` , if the console says something like `dm3q:/ $` you are good to go,{ **Note** : It might ask for permission it pop up while entering ( allow the permission ) }
   - Type `exit` to exit out of rish shell.
8. **Install dependencies**
   - ```
     cd ~ && apt update && apt upgrade && apt install git wget unzip coreutils grep gawk nano
     ```


---

9. Clone the repo and run the script(to take the latest release)

```
api_response=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/releases/latest)
latest_version=$(echo "$api_response" | grep -o '"tag_name": *"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
latest_version_clean=$(echo "$latest_version" | sed 's/^v//')
cd ~
rm -rf s23-vulkan-*
wget https://github.com/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/archive/refs/tags/$latest_version.zip
unzip $latest_version*.zip && rm $latest_version*.zip* && cd s23-vulkan-support-$latest_version && cd Without_PC
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

10. Follow the instructions.

11. After finishing all script running and all type `exit` in the termux or just swipe down to see the termux persistent notification in the notification panel and click exit over there.

## After Device Restart

**Note:** You only need to reapply Vulkan after a normal device restart. Samsung's auto-optimization restarts will NOT reset Vulkan rendering.

### Option 1: Get Latest Version (Recommended)
Run this command to download and apply the latest version (requires internet connection):
```
api_response=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/releases/latest)
latest_version=$(echo "$api_response" | grep -o '"tag_name": *"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
latest_version_clean=$(echo "$latest_version" | sed 's/^v//')
cd ~
rm -rf s23-vulkan-*
wget https://github.com/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/archive/refs/tags/$latest_version.zip
unzip $latest_version*.zip && rm $latest_version*.zip* && cd s23-vulkan-support-$latest_version && cd Without_PC
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
### Option 2: Use Existing Version(>=2.5.1 ; Please don't use builds before that)

If you don't have internet access or want to use your existing Version:
```
 cd ~/s23-vulkan-support*/Without_PC && ./script.sh
```

## How to Use the Blacklist Feature

The blacklist feature can help fix crashes or compatibility issues with certain applications when Vulkan is enabled. Here's how to use it:

### Creating and Editing the Blacklist File

1. **Create the blacklist.txt file** (if it doesn't exist already):
   ```bash
   nano blacklist.txt
   ```

2. **Add package names** to blacklist, one per line. For example:
   ```
   com.example.problematicapp
   com.social.unstableapp
   ```

3. **Save the file** by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`

4. **Exit nano** by pressing `Ctrl + X`

5. **Apply the blacklist** by running the script and selecting option 3 from the menu

### Finding Package Names

If you don't know an app's package name, you can find it by:

1. Going to Settings > Apps
2. Finding the app in question
3. Tapping on the app name
4. Scrolling down to "App details" or "App info"
5. Looking for "Package name" or "Application ID"

### Managing Your Blacklist

- **To add more apps**: Simply edit the blacklist.txt file again and run option 3
- **To remove apps**: Edit the file, delete the package names you want to remove, and run option 3 again
- **To clear all blacklisted apps**: Run this command:
  ```bash
  rish -c "settings put global game_driver_blacklist ''"
  ```

This blacklist feature is based on a community recommendation and may help prevent crashes for apps that don't work well with Vulkan rendering.

## How to Check if Vulkan is Active

To verify that Vulkan rendering is enabled:

1. **Open Developer Options** on your device.
2. **Enable GPUWatch.**
3. **Open any app** (for example, the Dialer).
4. GPUWatch will display an overlay-look for the renderer information.
   - If Vulkan is active, it will show something like: **Vulkan**

This is the easiest way to confirm that Vulkan is running on your Galaxy S23/S23+/S23U device.
